Name: Custom Module Loader
Author: Dominoes
Load cs files from a base "modules" folder. Includes two functions from the first installation, which may be removed at one's own expense:

Custom Shapenames (customnames.cs)
Change the shapename of a user. Does not persist when a user respawns or rejoins, yet.
Change "person" to a user's name, and "newname" to, well, the desired name.
/setcustomname person newname | /removecustomname person

VowelChat (vowelchat.cs)
Changes every vowel in a chat to an uppercase "O".
/togglevowelchat
